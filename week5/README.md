## Software Environment Setup

First login to CARC OnDemand: https://ondemand.carc.usc.edu/ and request a 'Discovery Cluster Shell Access' within OpenOnDemand. 

We will use Conda to build software packages. If it is the first time you are using Conda, make sure you follow the guide of how to use Conda with this link: https://www.carc.usc.edu/user-guides/data-science/building-conda-environment

We need to request an interactive session:
```bash
salloc --partition=gpu --gres=gpu:1 --cpus-per-task=8 --mem=32GB --time=1:00:00 --account=irahbari_1147 --reservation=itp-450-tu
```

If the reservation is not available, please use the following command to request an interactive session: 

```bash
salloc --partition=gpu --gres=gpu:1 --cpus-per-task=8 --mem=32GB --time=1:00:00 --account=irahbari_1147
```
To install Tensorboard: 

```
mamba activate torch-env
mamba install matplotlib tensorboard
```

## Tensorboard

TensorBoard is a powerful visualization tool. It provides developers and researchers with insights into their machine learning models by allowing them to visualize metrics, model graphs, and other key aspects of their workflows. Whether you’re debugging a model, tuning hyperparameters, or simply seeking a better understanding of your training process, TensorBoard offers a suite of features to facilitate these tasks.

Some key features of Tensorboard include: 

1 Showing images in TensorBoard

2 Graphing scalers and metrics to visualize training

3 Visualizing your model graphs

## Setup Tensorboard

Launch ‘Terminal’ Apps in OpenOnDemand :

Within the Terminal Apps, Change your working directory to week 5: 
```
cd /scratch1/$(whoami)/ITP450-DataScience-Fall2024/week5
```
Activate your Conda environment: 
```
conda activate torch-env
```

Launch Tensorboard in your Conda environment: 
```
tensorboard --logdir=runs
```

Right Click on the http://localhost:6006/ link and select ‘Open link’, this will launch a browser and start Tensorboard
